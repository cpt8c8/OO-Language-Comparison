# OO-Language-Comparison
## Kotlin Vs. Swift
## Samantha Trenholm and Matt Tschannen

### Language purpose/genesis
#### Why was the language created?
##### Kotlin
Kotlin was developed by JetBrains primarily for internal use. It was intended to boost productivty and improve workflow, which would result in improved sales.
##### Swift

#### What problems was the language trying to address?
##### Kotlin
JetBrains was looking for a language that adresses their needs, had fast compile times, was streamlined, and could ineract with a replace Java.
##### Swift

#### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
##### Kotlin
It was largely intended, as mentioned above, to be a replacement for Java.
##### Swift


### Unique features of the language
#### Does the language have any particularly unique features?
##### Kotlin
One of Kotlin's most loved features is its null safety, which protects it from null pointer exceptions. By using its simple ? operator, it first checks the value to see if it is null or not. If it’s not null then only then it will perform the next operation. It is used as shown. 

```val str:String? = "name"

Other things of note include that Kotlin is completely inter-operable with Java, its ability to return multiple values, and the ability to have default and named arguments (as shown below).

fun example(num: Int, str: String = "9") {}

example(15, "Hey")

example(str = "Name", num = 45) //Named argument

example(45) //usage of default argument
```
